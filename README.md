This repository is an example of a typical Terraform module repository structure with tests. This module deploys an Azure Virtual Network as well as configure a Network Security Group. There is also a helper module for peering Virtual Networks together.

The tests consist of a unit test, testing the ability to create a Virtual Network with a Network Security Group, and an integration test, testing the ability to peer to Virtual Networks together.
